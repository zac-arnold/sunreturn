Keria  didn’t discover music at a particular point in their life, it was always there, whether it was attending Flying Nun gigs with family as a kid and starting to sing and play guitar and piano at an early age. At high school, they connected with other passionate musicians and added bass and keyboards/synths to his repertoire, as well as beginning to experiment with recording and live music production. Before starting their own solo projects as K M T P, Paterson played with Auckland indie faves Polyester, as well as with Ethan Moore’s “bedroom stadium pop” project Dirty Pixels.",
